# AWS Image Rekognition Example

This console application demonstrate how to use the AWS Image Rekognition in C# (.NET Core). Since I did not find a working example, I created one myself.
The example comes with some animal pictures that can be used for testing the labels. This example comes without the need for any lambda or configuration within your AWS account. Just download and run it.


## Getting started

1. Make sure you configured your IAM User and your local environment like described in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/images-bytes.html
2. Run the sample
